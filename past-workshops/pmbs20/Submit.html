<p>Authors are invited to submit full papers with unpublished, original work. Submissions are limited to 10 pages 
using 10pt fonts in the <a href="http://www.ieee.org/conferences_events/conferences/publishing/templates.html">IEEE format</a>. 
The 10-page limit includes figures, tables, and your appendices, but does 
not include references, for which there is no page limit. Reproducibility initiative dependencies (Artifact 
Description or Computational Results Analysis) are also not included in the 10-page limit.</p>

<p>A separate Late-Breaking Research and Preliminary Techniques stream is also available for authors to submit 
5-page papers describing initial research or early first-of-a-kind results (this page limit does not include 
references but includes all technical content and figures).</p>

<p>All accepted full-length papers (subject to post-review revisions) will be published in the <a href="https://tc.computer.org/tchpc/">IEEE TCHPC 
Proceedings</a>.</p>

<a href="https://sc20.supercomputing.org/2020/07/27/sc20-virtual-event-announced-by-general-chair-christine-e-cuicchi/">announcement</a>
that SC20 will be a fully virtual conference, this years workshop will be held virtually on
Thursday 12th November. Authors of accepted papers will be required to submit a recorded presentation
that will be streamed online and followed by a live Q&amp;A.</div>

<h2 id="sc-transparency-and-reproducibility-initiative">SC Transparency and Reproducibility Initiative</h2>

<p>In line with the main Supercomputing conference, authors are asked to provide an artifact description and an artifact evaluation
appendix along with their paper, describing the details of their software environments and computational experiments to the 
extent that an independent person could replicate their results.</p>

<p>More information on the reproducibility initiative can be found <a href="https://sc20.supercomputing.org/submit/transparency-reproducibility-initiative/">here</a>.</p>

<h2 id="journal-special-issue">Journal Special Issue</h2>

<p>Authors of selected papers from 2019 and 2020 will also be invited to submit revised manuscripts for inclusion in a special issue 
of <a href="http://www.cc-pe.net/journalinfo/issues/2020.html#PMBS2020">Concurrency and Computation: Practice and Experience</a></p>
