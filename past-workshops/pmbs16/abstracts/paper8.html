<p>
NERSC has partnered with 20 representative application 
teams to evaluate performance on the Xeon-Phi Knights
Landing architecture and develop an application-optimization
strategy for the greater NERSC workload on the recently
installed Cori system. In this article, we present early case studies
and summarized results from a subset of the 20 applications
highlighting the impact of important architecture differences
between the Xeon-Phi and traditional Xeon processors. We
summarize the status of the applications and describe the greater
optimization strategy that has formed.
