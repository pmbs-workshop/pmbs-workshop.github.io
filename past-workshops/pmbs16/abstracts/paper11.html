<h1>Static Cost Estimation for Data Layout Selection on GPUs</h1>
<h3>Yuhan Peng, Max Grossman, Vivek Sarkar</h3>
<p>
Performance modeling provides mathematical
models and quantitative analysis for designing and optimizing
computer systems. In high performance architectures, high-latency 
memory accesses often dominate execution time in
many classes of applications. Thus, performance modeling for
memory accesses of high performance architectures has been
an important research topic. In high performance computation,
data layout can significantly affect the efficiency of memory
access operations. In recent years, the problem of data layout
selection has been well studied on various parallel CPU and
some GPU architectures. GPUs have memory hierarchies different 
from multi-core CPUs. While data layout selection on GPUs
has been inspected by several existing projects, there is still
a lack of a mathematical cost model for data layout selection
on GPUs. This motivates us to investigate static cost analysis
methods that could better guide future data layout selection
work, and perhaps even designing new SIMT architectures.
In this paper, we propose a comprehensive cost analysis for
data layout selection for GPUs. We build our cost function based
on the knowledge of the GPU memory hierarchy, and develop
an algorithm which allows researchers to perform compile
time cost estimation for a given data layout. Furthermore,
we introduce a new vector based representation to represent
the estimated cost, which can better estimate the cost of
applications with dynamic length loops. We apply our cost
analysis to selected benchmarks from past publications on data
layout selection. Our experimental results show that our cost
analysis can accurately predict the relative costs of different
data layouts. Using the cost model presented in this paper, we
are developing an automatic data layout selection tool in our
ongoing work.
