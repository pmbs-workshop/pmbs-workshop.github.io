<h1>A Performance Model for Allocating the Parallelism in a Multigrid-in-Time Solver</h1>

<p>
The traditional way to numerically solve time-dependent 
problems is to sequentially march through time,
solving for one time step and then the next. The parallelism in
this approach is limited to the spatial dimension, which is quickly
exhausted, causing the gain from using more processors to solve
a problem to diminish. One approach to overcome this barrier is
to use methods that are parallel in time. These methods have the
potential to achieve dramatically better performance compared
to time-stepping approaches, but achieving this performance
requires carefully choosing the amount of parallelism devoted
to space versus the amount devoted to time. Here, we present
a performance model that, for a multigrid-in-time solver, makes
the decision on when to switch to parallel-in-time and on how
much parallelism to devote to space vs. time. In our experiments,
the model selects the best parallel configuration in most of our
test cases and a configuration close to the best one in all other
cases.
