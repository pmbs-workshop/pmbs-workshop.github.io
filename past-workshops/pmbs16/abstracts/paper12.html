<h1>Visual Data-Analytics of Large-Scale Parallel Discrete-Event Simulations</h1>

Parallel discrete-event simulation (PDES) is an important 
tool in the codesign of extreme-scale systems because
PDES provides a cost-effective way to evaluate designs of high-performance 
computing systems. Optimistic synchronization algorithms 
for PDES, such as Time Warp, allow events to be
processed without global synchronization among the processing
elements. A rollback mechanism is provided when events are
processed out of timestamp order. Although optimistic synchronization 
protocols enable the scalability of large-scale PDES, the
performance of the simulations must be tuned to reduce the number 
of rollbacks and provide an improved simulation runtime.
To enable efficient large-scale optimistic simulations, one has to
gain insight into the factors that affect the rollback behavior and
simulation performance. We developed a tool for ROSS model
developers that gives them detailed metrics on the performance
of their large-scale optimistic simulations at varying levels of
simulation granularity. Model developers can use this information
for parameter tuning of optimistic simulations in order to achieve
better runtime and fewer rollbacks. In this work, we instrument
the ROSS optimistic PDES framework to gather detailed statistics
about the simulation engine. We have also developed an interactive 
visualization interface that uses the data collected by the
ROSS instrumentation to understand the underlying behavior of
the simulation engine. The interface connects real time to virtual
time in the simulation and provides the ability to view simulation
data at different granularities. We demonstrate the usefulness of
our framework by performing a visual analysis of the dragonfly
network topology model provided by the CODES simulation
framework built on top of ROSS. The instrumentation needs
to minimize overhead in order to accurately collect data about
the simulation performance. To ensure that the instrumentation
does not introduce unnecessary overhead, we perform a scaling
study that compares instrumented ROSS simulations with their
noninstrumented counterparts in order to determine the amount
of perturbation when running at different simulation scales.
