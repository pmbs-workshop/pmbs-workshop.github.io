<h1>Effective Use of Large High-Bandwidth Memory Caches in HPC Stencil Computation via Temporal Wave-Front Tiling</h1>
<h3>Charles Yount, Alejandro Duran</h3>
<p>
Stencil computation is an important class of algorithms 
used in a large variety of scientific-simulation applications.
The performance of stencil calculations is often bounded by
memory bandwidth. High-bandwidth memory (HBM) on devices
such as those in the Intel Xeon Phi x200 processor family
(code-named Knights Landing) can thus provide additional
performance. In a traditional sequential time-step approach,
the additional bandwidth can be best utilized when the stencil
data fits into the HBM, restricting the problem sizes that can
be undertaken and under-utilizing the larger DDR memory
on the platform. As problem sizes become significantly larger
than the HBM, the effective bandwidth approaches that of the
DDR, degrading performance. This paper explores the use of
temporal wave-front tiling to add an additional layer of cache-blocking 
to allow efficient use of both the HBM bandwidth
and the DDR capacity. Details of the cache-blocking and wavefront 
tiling algorithms are given, and results on a Xeon Phi
processor are presented, comparing performance across problem
sizes and among four experimental configurations. Analyses of
the bandwidth utilization and HBM-cache hit rates are also
provided, illustrating the correlation between these metrics and
performance. It is demonstrated that temporal wave-front tiling
can provide a 2.4x speedup compared to using HBM cache
without temporal tiling and 3.3x speedup compared to only using
DDR memory for large problem sizes.
