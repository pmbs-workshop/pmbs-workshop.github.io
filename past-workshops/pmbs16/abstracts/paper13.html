<h1>Enabling Work Migration in CoMD to Study Dynamic Load Imbalance Solutions</h1>
<h3>Olga Pearce, David F. Richards, Hadia Ahmed, Rasmus W. Larsen</h3>
<p>
We have enabled work migration in the CoMD
proxy application to study dynamic load imbalance. Proxy
applications are developed to simplify studying parallel performance 
of scientific simulations and to test potential solutions for
performance problems. However, proxy applications are typically
too simple to allow work migration or to represent the load
imbalance of their parent applications. To study the ability of load
balancing solutions to balance work effectively, we enable work
migration in one of the ExMatEx proxy applications, CoMD. We
design a methodology to parameterize three key aspects necessary
for studying load imbalance correction: 1) the granularity with
which work can be migrated; 2) the initial load imbalance;
3) the dynamic load imbalance (how quickly the load changes
over time). We present a study of the impact of flexibility in
work migration in CoMD on load balance and the associated
rebalancing costs for a wide range of initial and dynamic load
imbalance scenarios.
