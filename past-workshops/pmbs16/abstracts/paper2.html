<h1>An Evaluation of Network Architectures for Next Generation Supercomputers</h1>
<h3>Dong Chen, Philip Heidelberger, Craig Stunkel, Yutaka Sugawara, Cyriel Minkenberg, German Rodriguez, Bogdan Prisacari</h3>
<p>
We survey network topologies, in particular networks with full 
all-to-all bandwidth scaling. For more detailed
study, we select several recently introduced, promising networks
that are cheaper than a 3-level Fat-tree. Through a combination
of analysis and simulation on selected supercomputer workloads,
we compare these networks according to desirable network properties 
such as robust performance, low cost, and partitionability.
We conclude with observations for future systems.
