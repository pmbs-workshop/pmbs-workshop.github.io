<h1>GEOPM: A Vehicle for HPC Community Collaboration Toward Co-Designed Energy Management Solutions</h1>

Performance of future large-scale HPC systems will
be limited by costs associated with scaling power. Some HPC
centers are reaching the limits of their existent site power delivery
infrastructure and are facing prohibitive upgrade costs. Others
are reaching budgetary limits on their energy operating costs.
Without a breakthrough in energy efficiency, the HPC industry
may fail to maintain historical performance scaling rates and fall
short of 2018-2020 Exascale performance goals by an estimated 2-3x
margin. Overcoming this gap will require co-designed
hardware and software system energy management solutions and
increased collaboration between hardware vendors and the HPC
software community. In this work, we introduce the Global
Extensible Open Power Manager (GEOPM): a tree-hierarchical,
plug-in extensible, open source runtime framework that we are
contributing to the HPC community to accelerate collaboration
and research toward co-designed energy management solutions.
First results with an experimental power rebalancing optimization
demonstrate up to 32% improvements in the runtime of CORAL
system procurement benchmarks like miniFE and Nekbone in a
power-limited Xeon Phi cluster. These promising initial results
motivate further work with the community to extend GEOPM to
new optimization strategies to achieve further speedups.
