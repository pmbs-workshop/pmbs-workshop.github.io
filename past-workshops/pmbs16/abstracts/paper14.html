<h1>Reproducible Stencil Compiler Benchmarks Using PROVA!</h1>
<h3>Danilo Guerrera, Helmar Burkhart, Antonio Maffia</h3>
<p>
The stencil pattern represents a vast variety of
applications, ranging from geophysics to medical science. In application 
codes, the stencil kernel is often the part where most of
the time is spent, thus forcing an efficient parallel implementation
of it. On the other side we know that stencil computations are
often memory-bound, which requires sophisticated parallelization
techniques to get scalable solutions.
</br>
In this paper we present the results of a stencil benchmark
experiment run on two different systems by means of the
PROVA! tool we are currently implementing. PROVA! aims for
reproducible performance experiments and makes collaborative
stencil benchmarking feasible through web repositories and
interfaces.
