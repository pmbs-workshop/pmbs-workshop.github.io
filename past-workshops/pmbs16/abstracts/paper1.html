<h1>HPC Benchmarking: Problem Size Matters</h1>
<h3>Vladimir Marjanovi&#263;, Jos&eacute; Gracia, Colin W. Glass</h3>
<p>
In order to compare and rank the worlds fastest
computers, benchmarks evaluating their performance are required. 
A single execution of HPL is used for the most widely recognized 
ranking: the TOP500. Lately, two benchmarks, arguably
more representative of typical modern workloads, have been
proposed: HPCG and HPGMG. Currently, all three benchmarks
use the highest observed performance from a single problem size
for ranking. In this paper we report benchmarking result for
all three benchmarks with a wide range of problem sizes on
six distinct hardware architectures, covering the full range of
machines present on the TOP500 list. We find that the data holds
significantly more information on the performance of the underlying 
hardware as compared to just the maximum performance
observed. We therefore argue that an aggregate value derived
from a whole range of problem sizes can significantly improve the
sensitivity of a given benchmark to relevant hardware properties
and thus be more representative. However, we refrain from
proposing the specific way to best compose such an aggregate
and invite the community to open the discussion on the topic.
