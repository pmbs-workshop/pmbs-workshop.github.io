<h1>A Metric for Performance Portability</h1>
<h3>Simon John Pennycook, Jason Sewall, Victor Lee</h3>
<p>
The term "performance portability" has been informally 
used in computing to refer to a variety of notions which
generally include: 1) the ability to run one application across
multiple hardware platforms; and 2) achieving some notional
level of performance on these platforms. However, there has
been a noticeable lack of consensus on the precise meaning
of the term, and authors' conclusions regarding their success
(or failure) to achieve performance portability have thus been
subjective. Comparing one approach to performance portability
with another has generally been marked with vague claims and
verbose, qualitative explanation of the comparison. This paper
presents a concise definition for performance portability, along
with a simple metric that accurately captures the performance
and portability of an application across different platforms. The
utility of this metric is then demonstrated with a retroactive
application to previous work.
