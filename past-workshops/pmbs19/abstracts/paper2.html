<h1>An Instruction Roofline Model for GPUs</h1>
<h3>Nan Ding and Samuel Williams</h3>
<p>
The Roofline performance model provides an intuitive approach to identify performance bottlenecks and guide performance optimization. However, the classic FLOP-centric is inappropriate for the emerging applications that perform more integer operations than floating-point operations. In this paper, we propose an Instruction Roofline Model on NVIDIA GPUs. The Instruction Roofline incorporates instructions and memory transactions across all memory hierarchies together and provides more performance insights than the FLOP-oriented Roofline Model, i.e., instruction throughput, stride memory access patterns, bank conflicts, and thread predication. We use our Instruction Roofline methodology to analyze five proxy applications: HPGMG from AMReX, BatchSW from merAligner, Matrix Transpose benchmarks, cudaTensorCoreGemm, and cuBLAS. We demonstrate the ability of our methodology to understand various aspects of performance and performance bottlenecks on NVIDIA GPUs and motivate code optimizations.
