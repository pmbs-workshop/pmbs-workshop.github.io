<strong>A Methodology for Evaluating Tightly-integrated and Disaggregated Accelerated Architectures</strong></p>

<p><em>Tighter integration of computational resources can foster superior application performance by mitigating communication bottlenecks. Unfortunately, not every application can use every compute or accelerator all the time. As a result, co-locating resources often leads to under-utilization of resources. To mitigate this challenge, architects have proposed disaggregation and ad hoc pooling of computational resources. In the next five years, HPC system architects will be presented with a spectrum of accelerated solutions ranging from tightly coupled, single package APUs to a sea of disaggregated GPUs interconnected by a global network. In this paper, we detail NEthing, our methodology and tool for evaluating the potential performance implications of such diverse architectural paradigms. We demonstrate our methodology on todayâ€™s and projected 2026 technologies for three distinct workloads: a compute-intensive kernel, a tightly-coupled HPC simulation, and an ensemble of loosely-coupled HPC simulations. Our results leverage NEthing to quantify the increased utilization disaggregated systems must achieve in order to match superior performance of APUs and on-board GPUs.</em></p>
