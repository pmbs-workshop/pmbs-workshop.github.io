<h1>Characterizing Node Orderings for Improved Performance</h1>
<h3>Carl Albing</h3>
<p>
High Performance Computing (HPC) job performance can 
vary because of location in the HPC system interconnect. 
Contiguous and compact allocations of compute nodes for 
parallel jobs is ideal but infeasible once other jobs have been 
placed. Non-contiguous allocations of individual nodes is ef- 
fective, but increased dispersal can decrease performance. 
Reasonable performance of parallel applications has been 
achieved through application placement in 3D-torus HPC 
systems using allocation strategies based on an ordered, one- 
dimensional sequence of nodes. Ordering of this list, node 
ordering, is an inexpensive way to incorporate topological 
information into the placement decision. With several or- 
derings from which to choose - and others that could be 
created - what is the basis for choosing one ordering over 
others? Can the choice be made with out expensive, time- 
consuming benchmarks? 
</p><p>
A method is described in this paper for the evaluation of 
node orderings for grid and torus interconnects based on a 
measure of application compactness at locations through- 
out the ordering. Several node orderings are evaluated for 
actual HPC systems across three sizes. Results provide vi- 
sually compelling guidance on the choice of node ordering. 
The choice is dependent not only on system size but may 
also be dependent on typical job sizes. Some orderings can 
be seen to be a consistently poor choice regardless of job 
size; most orderings are seen to be better only for a range 
of job sizes. Rarely an ordering is consistently better over 
the full range of job sizes - but only for a certain size and 
shape of system interconnect. This evalution method pro- 
vides a cost-effective way to evaluate orderings and thereby 
provide generally improved application performance on HPC 
systems.
