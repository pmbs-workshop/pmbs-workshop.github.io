<h1>Performance Evaluation of the IBM POWER8 system to Support Computational Neuroscientific Application Using Morphologically Detailed Neurons</h1>
<h3>Timothee Ewart, Stuart Yates, Francesco Cremonesi, Pramod Shivaji, Fabien Delalondre, Felix Schuermann</h3>
<p>
A part of large-scale future supercomputing architectures will rely on a combination of
IBM POWER9 and Nvidia GPU processors. In order to anticipate software design, implementation 
and optimization decisions and optimally prepare scientific applications targetting exascale 
computing, it is mandatory to already analyze application performance on prototype hardware.
In this article an evaluation of the performance of the IBM POWER8 system is provided
in the context of a widely-used computational neuroscientific application 
modeling large-scale neuronal network and using detailed morphologies referred as NEURON.
This evaluation describes in details the way to accurately model the performance of 
the system but also provides a first detailed analysis of representative kernels of NEURON.
From this analysis, optimization opportunities can be suggested at the level of the 
application but also at the level of the performance measurement and system setup.
