<h1>Automatic Loop Kernel Analysis and Performance Modeling With Kerncraft</h1>
<h3>Julian Hammer, Georg Hager, Jan Eitzinger, Gerhard Wellein</h3>
<p>
Analytic performance models are essential for understanding 
the performance characteristics of loop kernels, which consume a major
part of CPU cycles in computational science. Starting from a validated
performance model one can infer the relevant hardware bottlenecks and
promising optimization opportunities. Unfortunately, analytic
performance modeling is often tedious even for experienced developers
since it requires in-depth knowledge about the hardware and how it
interacts with the software. We present the "Kerncraft" tool,
which eases the construction of analytic performance models for
streaming kernels and stencil loop nests. Starting from the loop source code, the
problem size, and a description of the underlying hardware, Kerncraft
can ideally predict the single-core performance and scaling behavior
of loops on multicore processors using the Roofline or the
Execution-Cache-Memory (ECM) model. We describe the operating
principles of Kerncraft with its capabilities and limitations, and we
show how it may be used to quickly gain insights by accelerated
analytic modeling.
