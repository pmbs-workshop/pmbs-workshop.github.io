<h1>Simulating Stencil-based Application on Future Xeon Phi Processor</h1>
<h3>Chitra Natarajan, Carl Beckmann, Anthony Nguyen, Tryggve Fossum, Mauricio Araya-Polo, Detlef Hohl</h3>
<p>
A relevant application for hydrocarbon exploration is simulated on a novel Intel architecture. The accuracy of the simulation models is demonstrated by correlating against an existing processor first and then against high-accuracy simulation tools used for the new architecture. The results show that key architectural features of the coming KNL processor will positively impact the performance of the application.
