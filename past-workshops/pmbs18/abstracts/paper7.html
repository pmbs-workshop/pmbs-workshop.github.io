<h1>Unified Cross-Platform Profiling of Parallel C++ Applications </h1>
<h3>Vladyslav Kucher, Florian Fey and Sergei Gorlatch</h3>
<p>
To address the great variety of available parallel hardware architectures (CPUs, GPUs, etc.), high-performance applications increasingly demand cross-platform portability. While unified programming models like OpenCL or SYCL provide the ultimate portability of code, the profiling of applications in the development process is still done by using different platform-specific tools of the corresponding hardware vendors. We design and implement a unified, cross-platform profiling interface by extending the PACXX framework for unified programming in C++. With our profiling interface, a single tool is used to profile parallel C++ applications across different target platforms. We illustrate and evaluate our uniform profiler using an example application of matrix multiplication for CPU and GPU architectures.
