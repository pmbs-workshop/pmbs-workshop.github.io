Benchmarking of high performance computing systems can help provide critical insights for efficient design of computing systems and software applications. Although a large number of tools for benchmarking exist, there is a lack of representative benchmarks for the class of irregular computations as exemplified by graph analytics. In this paper, we propose miniVite as a representative graph analytics benchmark tool to test a variety of distributed-memory systems. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graph clustering, popularly known as community detection, is a prototypical graph operation used in numerous scientific computing and analytics applications. The goal of clustering is to partition a graph into clusters (or communities) such that each cluster consists of vertices that are densely connected within the cluster and sparsely connected to the rest of the graph. Modularity optimization is a popular technique for identifying clusters in a graph. Efficient parallelization of modularity optimization-based algorithms is challenging. One successful approach was conceived in Vite, a distributed-memory implementation of the Louvain algorithm that incorporates several heuristics. <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We introduce miniVite as a representative but simplified variant of Vite, to serve as a prototypical graph analytics benchmarking tool. Unlike other graph-based methods such as breadth-first search and betweenness centrality, miniVite represents highly complex computational patterns stressing a variety of system features, which can provide crucial insight for co-design of future computing systems.
