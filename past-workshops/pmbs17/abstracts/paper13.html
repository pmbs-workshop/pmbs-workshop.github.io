<h1>Periodic I/O scheduling for super-computers</h1>
<h3>Guillaume Aupy, Ana Gainaru, and Valentin Le F&egrave;vre</h3>
<p>
With the ever-growing need of data in HPC applications, the congestion at the
I/O level becomes critical in super-computers. Architectural enhancement such as
burst-buffers and pre-fetching are added to machines, but are not sufficient to
prevent congestion. Recent online I/O scheduling strategies have been put in
place, but they add an additional congestion point and overheads in the
computation of applications. 

In this work, we show how to take advantage of the periodic nature of HPC
applications in order to develop efficient periodic scheduling strategies
for their I/O transfers. 
Our strategy computes once during the job scheduling phase a pattern where it
defines the I/O behavior for each application, after which the applications run
independently, transferring their I/O at the specified times. Our strategy limits
the amount of I/O congestion at the I/O node level and can be easily integrated
into current job schedulers. We validate this model through extensive simulations
and experiments by comparing it to state-of-the-art online solutions.

Specifically, we show that not only our scheduler has the advantage of being
de-centralized, thus overcoming the overhead of online schedulers, but we
also show that on Mira one can expect an average dilation improvement of 22\%
with an average throughput improvement of 32\%!
Finally, we show that one can expect those improvements to get better in the
next generation of platforms where the compute - I/O bandwidth imbalance
increases.
