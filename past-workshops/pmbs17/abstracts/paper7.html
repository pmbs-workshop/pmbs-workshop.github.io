<h1>A Survey of Application Memory Usage on a National Supercomputer: An Analysis of Memory Requirements on ARCHER</h1>
<h3>Andy Turner and Simon McIntosh-Smith</h3>
<p>
In this short paper we set out to provide a set of modern data on the
actual memory per core and memory per node requirements of the most
heavily used applications on a contemporary, national-scale
supercomputer. This report is based on data from all jobs run on the
UK national supercomputing service, ARCHER, a 118,000 core Cray XC30,
in the 1 year period from 1st July 2016 to 30th June 2017 inclusive.
Our analysis shows that 80% of all usage on ARCHER has a maximum
memory use of 1 GiB/core or less (24 GiB/node or less) and that there
is a trend to larger memory use as job size increases. Analysis of
memory use by software application type reveals differences in memory
use between periodic electronic structure, atomistic N-body,
grid-based climate modelling, and grid-based CFD applications. We
present an analysis of these differences, and suggest further
analysis and work in this area. Finally, we discuss the implications
of these results for the design of future HPC systems, in particular
the applicability of high bandwidth memory type technologies.
