**11:10 - 11:30**\\
**Benchmarking the Evolution of Performance and Energy Efficiency Across Recent Generations of Intel Xeon Processors**

_In the span of 1.5 years, Intel has launched four families of Xeon processors, with some novel architectural features. First, the Sapphire Rapids generation, which featured a version with on-package HBM; next, the Emerald Rapids generation; and then Intel differentiated by releasing the performance-oriented Granite Rapids and the efficiency-oriented Sierra Forest families. In this work, we evaluate the performance and efficiency of CPUs from each of these generations and variants, with a particular focus on bandwidth-bound high performance computing (HPC) applications. We contrast runtime and energy consumption figures and track trends across generations._
