PMBS 2024 :: Call for Papers

15th International Workshop on Performance Modeling, 
Benchmarking and Simulation of High Performance Computer Systems

held in conjunction with IEEE/ACM SC24, Atlanta, GA, November 2024

http://www.pmbsworkshop.org

===============================================================================


The PMBS24 workshop is concerned with the comparison of high-performance 
computer systems through performance modeling, benchmarking or through the use
of tools such as simulators.

We are particularly interested in research which reports the ability to measure
and make trade-offs in software/hardware co-design to improve sustained
application performance. We are also keen to capture the assessment of future
systems, for example through work that ensures continued application
scalability through peta- and exa-scale systems.

The aim of this workshop is to bring together researchers, from industry and
academia, concerned with the qualitative and quantitative evaluation and 
modeling of high-performance computing systems. Authors are invited to submit 
novel research in all areas of performance modeling, benchmarking and 
simulation, and we welcome research that brings together current theory and 
practice. We recognize that the coverage of the term performance has broadened 
to include power consumption and reliability, and that performance modeling is 
practiced through analytical methods and approaches based on software tools and 
simulators.

We encourage submissions in the following areas:

 * Performance modeling, analysis, and prediction of applications and 
   high-performance computing systems
 * Novel techniques and tools for performance evaluation and prediction
 * Advanced simulation techniques and tools
 * Micro-benchmarking, application benchmarking and tracing
 * Performance-driven code optimization and scalability analysis
 * Verification and validation of performance models
 * Benchmarking and performance analysis of novel hardware
 * Performance concerns in software/hardware co-design
 * Tuning and auto-tuning of HPC applications and algorithms
 * Benchmark suites
 * Performance visualization
 * Real-world case studies
 * Studies of heterogeneous architectures and many-core accelerators

Work which examines similar topics will also be considered.

=== Submission Guidelines ===

Authors are invited to submit full papers with unpublished, original work. 
Submissions are limited to 8 pages using 10pt fonts in the IEEE conference 
proceedings template. The 8-page limit includes figures and tables, but does 
not include appendices and references. 

A separate Late-Breaking Research and Preliminary Techniques stream is also 
available for authors to submit 4-page papers, not including appendices or 
references, describing initial research or early first-of-a-kind results.

The review process will be double anonymous, and authors should prepare 
their papers as such, removing author names and institutes; failure to do 
so will result in the paper being rejected without review.

Accepted full papers will be eligible for 2 additional pages, while short 
papers will be eligible for 1 additional page.

=== SC Transparency and Reproducibility Initiative ===

In line with the main Supercomputing conference, authors are asked to provide 
an artifact description and an artifact evaluation appendix along with their 
paper, describing the details of their software environments and computational 
experiments to the extent that an independent person could replicate their 
results.
