_Approximate and low-precision computing are essential for modern applications, and effectively leveraging available precision options can deliver substantial gains in performance and energy efficiency. We focus on the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT), a representative function used in scientific computing, and propose a wrapper library to exploit these options. Using multiple GPU-accelerated FFT libraries, we observe that different libraries excel in different regions of the performanceâ€“accuracy space and that these sweet spots depend on transform size and input content. Guided by these insights, we propose a framework that selects the best kernel (library and precision) on the fly to minimize runtime or energy while satisfying a specified error threshold. A lightweight machine learning model predicts per-kernel error at runtime from sampled input features. Experiments show over 98% selection accuracy and mean speedups exceeding 40\% compared to a double precision baseline. The framework integrates seamlessly with existing workflows as a wrapper library._
